# 💡 Inspiration
We saw the capabilities of GPT-3 in the news and wanted to leverage its power for a practical application of our own. We also knew that therapy can sometimes be prohibitively expensive and wanted to lower the access barrier.

# 🏗 How we built it
* Designed Mockups in Adobe XD
* Talk With Me was made using Flutter with the help of the following libraries:
* Used `gpt_3_dart` API for GPT-3 integration
* Used `speech_to_text` for speech-to-text
* Used `flutter_tts` for text-to-speech

# 🛑 Challenges we ran into

# ✅ Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Switching from a game to an app, since we thought an app would be a more accessible form factor

# 📖 What we learned
* More APIs for flutter
* Interfacing with GPT-3
* Advanced Flutter Concepts
* Adobe XD design

# 💡 Future Improvements
* Updates to UI to improve smoothness
* Add meditation feature with generative audio
* Expand breadth of issues the therapist can handle
