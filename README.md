# :bulb: Inspiration
We saw the capabilities of GPT-3 in the news and wanted to leverage its power for a practical application of our own. We also knew that therapy can sometimes be prohibitavley expensive and wanted to lower the access barrier.

# :building_construction: How we built it
* Designed Mockups in Adobe XD
* Created app in flutter
* Used `gpt_3_dart` API for GPT-3 integration
* Used `[NAME]` for audio visializations
* Used `[NAME]` for speech-to-text
* Used `[NAME]` for text-to-speech

# :stop_sign: Challenges we ran into

#	:white_check_mark: Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Switching from a game to an app, since we thought an app would be a more accessible form factor

# :open_book: What we learned

# :thought_balloon: Future Improvements
* Updates to UI to improve smoothness
* Add meditation feature with generative audio
* Expand breadth of issues the therapist can handle
